	<headline xmlns="http://www.semanticweb.org/newsanalytics/ontologies/2016//">Twenty20, a Faster Variant of Cricket, Gets Players to Stay Home</headline>
	<snippet xmlns="http://www.semanticweb.org/newsanalytics/ontologies/2016//">Unlike most sports, cricket traditionally has revolved around international play, regarded as more prestigious and lucrative than domestic competition. It is not just glamour in which domestic play lags; it is often subsidized by the money received from international play, too. But in recent weeks in Australia, domestic matches have reasserted their ascendance. In the traditional Boxing Day Test match in Melbourne that started Dec. 26, pitting Australia against the West Indies, the total crowd over four days was 127,069, the lowest total in 21 years. Meanwhile, crowds in the Big Bash League, the domestic Twenty20 tournament run by Cricket Australia, have hit record highs: 80,883 attended a derby match in Melbourne on Jan. 2, breaking the previous record by almost 30,000. It is part of a broader pattern of rising interest in the eight-team B.B.L., which started in 2011. Over the first 27 games of this season, television viewership has increased by 100,000 per match, to 1.01 million, and the average attendance has grown by 4,000 to 28,000 per game, according to Cricket Australia, the ruling body of the sport in the country.</snippet>

	<headline xmlns="http://www.semanticweb.org/newsanalytics/ontologies/2016//">One-and-Done System Gets a Documentary. Call It a Farce.</headline>
	<snippet xmlns="http://www.semanticweb.org/newsanalytics/ontologies/2016//">One-and-done players have become commonplace. In this year’s N.B.A. draft, 14 of the first 41 players selected were coming off their freshman seasons at American colleges. John Calipari of Kentucky was among the first college coaches to openly recruit one-and-dones. Now even former critics, like Duke’s Mike Krzyzewski, understand that to get the best players, they have to recruit athletes who intend to leave after a year. Simmons was last season’s best-known one-and-done. He wound up at Louisiana State University not because it had a chance to go deep in the tournament (it did not) or because he admired the coach, but because his godfather worked there as an assistant coach. Simmons’s family relocated to Baton Rouge, La., to support him. As it turns out, his parents also took with them two filmmakers, Maura Mandt and Josh Swade, whom they had invited to document their son’s journey to the N.B.A. The documentary that Mandt and Swade ultimately produced, which will have its premiere on Showtime on Friday, is at once shocking and unsurprising. The film covers Simmons’s last year in high school, the buildup to the draft, his picking of an agent and his signing of a shoe contract, but its primary focus is on that year Simmons spent at L.S.U. Hence its title: “One &amp; Done.”</snippet>

	<snippet xmlns="http://www.semanticweb.org/newsanalytics/ontologies/2016//">Australia coach Ange Postecoglou was unhappy with the way his side started and finished Thursdays 2-2 draw with Saudi Arabia but said he was relatively satisfied to have taken four points from tough World Cup qualifiers in Jeddah and Abu Dhabi. The Socceroos got off to a nervous start at King Abdullah Sports City and fell behind after five minutes to Taiseer Al Jassam's opener, but gradually gained control and silenced the 51,000 crowd with goals from Trent Sainsbury and Tomi Juric. The Saudis put the visitors under immense pressure in the final quarter and equalised with 10 minutes remaining through substitute striker Nasser Al Shamrani, who was recalled to the squad after an 18-month absence. Al Shamrani received an eight-match ban in 2014 for spitting at Australian defender Matt Spiranovic after the second leg of the Asian Champions League final in Riyadh. Australia lead Group B on goal difference from Saudi Arabia with both teams on seven points from three games. The Socceroos host fourth-placed Japan on Tuesday, while Saudi Arabia host United Arab Emirates, who are third in the group. "Obviously not getting off to an ideal start didn't help. They came out of the blocks pretty quickly," Postecoglou told Fox Sports. </snippet>

Without  playing a single point, Murray ended a seven-year wait to secure the No. 1 spot after advancing to the Paris Masters final because of Milos Raonic’s withdrawal from the tournament. Murray learned that Raonic had a leg injury just one hour before they were scheduled to meet in the semifinals on Saturday. “The way that it happened today was quite strange,” Murray said. “I had always imagined, obviously, doing it on the court. Like last night, before I went to bed, I was imagining doing it, kind of thinking about it happening on the court after a match.” Murray still gave the Paris fans something to cheer about: He took to the court for a practice session and hit a few shots with the ball boys and girls.</snippet>

	<snippet xmlns="http://www.semanticweb.org/newsanalytics/ontologies/2016//">Australian football fans must tone down their dress and resist chanting or any "joyful activities" if they want to support the Socceroos at their World Cup qualifier with Thailand next month. The Nov. 15 match will go ahead as originally planned, Football Federation Australia (FFA) said on Friday, but both the Australians and Thai hosts have asked fans to be mindful the host nation is mourning following the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej. The Football Association of Thailand (FAT) had sought to move the match out of respect for the long-reigning monarch, who died earlier this month aged 88. But FFA on Friday confirmed the 2018 World Cup qualifier would be played at Bangkok's Rajamangala Stadium as originally scheduled, and asked fans to respect local customs and a series of requests from the Thais. The Australian body asked fans to respect a number of requests it said were from the Sports Authority of Thailand, including that clothing for spectators "shall be in polite manner with suggested colors such as white, black, gray and preferably with no designs on them". Banners, drums, trumpets, flags, megaphones, whistles and cheering sticks have been banned from the stadium, while FFA said the Sports Authority of Thailand had said fan chants would be strictly prohibited both inside and around the venue.</snippet>

	<headline xmlns="http://www.semanticweb.org/newsanalytics/ontologies/2016//">Former Australia Skipper Taylor Bats for Four-Day Tests</headline>
	<snippet xmlns="http://www.semanticweb.org/newsanalytics/ontologies/2016//">Former Australian captain Mark Taylor has pitched in to the debate on how to revive spectator interest in test cricket, calling for the games longest format to be shortened by a day to encourage more attacking intent. Test matches have witnessed a steady decline in attendances in recent years, throwing the door open to a number of novel means to engage fans, including the introduction of day-night tests. Taylor said making tests four-day affairs instead of five would help them become more viewer friendly and envisaged a scenario where matches could begin on Thursday and end on Sunday -- in a manner similar to golf tournaments. "It'll only add to the appeal of the game, make it a bit shorter and a bit faster," the former opening batsman told Melbourne's Sports Entertainment Network (SEN) radio station. "That's what people of this generation want to see. You've got one less day to win, lose or draw a game, so it does force captains and players to be a little bit more aggressive in their thinking." With test matches coming in for stiff competition from the game's newer, shorter formats, such as Twenty20 internationals and leagues, Taylor added that holding day-night tests was not the only option on the table. "The numbers around the world are dying in some countries," the Cricket Australia board member said. "That's why I think we have got to have the stuff like the day-night test matches and... start thinking seriously about having four-day games of test cricket."</snippet>

	<snippet xmlns="http://www.semanticweb.org/newsanalytics/ontologies/2016//">The hype began to build hours before the puck dropped Tuesday night — unusual for an N.H.L. game just a few weeks into the regular season. The Edmonton Oilers’ captain, Connor McDavid, and the Toronto Maple Leafs’ rookie sensation, Auston Matthews, gave separate news conferences after the pregame skate. (Matthews actually gave two — one for television crews and one for print reporters — when it became clear the demand was too great for just one.) Hockey royalty was in the building, too: Wayne Gretzky, a vice chairman of Oilers Entertainment Group, who led Edmonton to four Stanley Cup titles as a player and flew in for the game, and Bobby Orr, the Hall of Fame defenseman who is now McDavid’s agent. They had come to witness the first head-to-head N.H.L. meeting of McDavid and Matthews, two 19-year-old superstars-in-the-making. “You can see and feel the electricity in the air,” Gretzky said.</snippet>

	<snippet xmlns="http://www.semanticweb.org/newsanalytics/ontologies/2016//">The Detroit Red Wings have begun their final season at Joe Louis Arena. And when they move out next year, it will be the end for an arena with a feature that is exceedingly rare in major North American sports. Joe Louis is one of a tiny number of high-profile stadiums or arenas named for an athlete. This shortage is somewhat puzzling. Athletes, after all, perform the feats that make the stadiums special places. It is partly because so many stadiums are named after sponsors, to bring in additional revenue. Although the names hardly call forth sporting glory, there are major pro league games at Petco Park, Qualcomm Stadium, Vivint Smart Home Arena and Canadian Tire Centre. Yet even the stadiums that still carry the names of famous individuals seldom honor athletes. Although their athleticism may not go beyond signing a check, owners have been well represented, at places like Paul Brown Stadium and Wrigley Field. Coaches (Lambeau Field) and politicians (R.F.K. Stadium) are also honored. And even in the pre-sponsorship era, few stadiums were named after athletes. Out of hundreds of stadiums used for major pro league games over the years, only a small handful have carried the name of an athlete. To find them, you have to dig deep into history.</snippet>

After a narrow win in the opening test against Bangladesh in Chittagong, England suffered an astonishing collapse on the third day of the second match at Dhaka, losing 10 wickets in a single session in their second innings to be all out for 164. Next up for Alastair Cook's men is a testing series in India, starting on Nov. 9, on spin-friendly pitches similar to those England struggled with against Bangladesh.</snippet>

	<snippet xmlns="http://www.semanticweb.org/newsanalytics/ontologies/2016//">Getting eliminated early as host of a global championship is bad enough, but one thing that can make it worse is when it happens at the hand of your bitterest rival. That’s the prospect facing India as it plays Pakistan in the World Twenty20 in Kolkata, India, on Saturday.India already lost its first match of the tournament against New Zealand Tuesday, when it was bowled out for only 79 runs. Pakistan, meanwhile, opened with a victory over Afghanistan. India will not be eliminated if it loses Saturday, but would need to win its two remaining pool matches against Australia and Afghanistan, and for other results to break in its favor, to have any chance of progressing as one of the top two from the five-team pool. This is not what either India’s vast cricketing public, or the oddsmakers who made it a clear favorite, expected. But World T20s are hard to predict. “If you look at the World T20 events that happened before, none of the teams that won were thought of as favorites before the event began,” said Pakistan’s coach, Waqar Younis, before the tournament. “If you play well in those three weeks, you can win the cup.”</snippet>

	<snippet xmlns="http://www.semanticweb.org/newsanalytics/ontologies/2016//">England will climb to the top of the one-day international (ODI) cricket world rankings if they can maintain their fine form in the format, all-rounder Ben Stokes said after the side completed a series victory in Bangladesh. Stokes played a key role with an unbeaten 47 as England won the deciding third match against the hosts in Chittagong on Wednesday to wrap up a third successive one-day series triumph, having beaten Sri Lanka and Pakistan at home earlier this year. England are currently fifth in the ODI rankings, behind Australia, South Africa, New Zealand and India. "It's really exciting. If we carry on like this we'll achieve our target of being world number one," Stokes, who was named the man of the series, told Sky Sports. England's loss to Bangladesh in Adelaide, which knocked them out of the 2015 ODI World Cup, spurred a string of changes to the national team set-up and Stokes felt the squad are starting to yield the dividends of the strategy. "The team we have had together for the last 18 months have been playing unbelievable cricket," the 25-year-old added. With skipper Eoin Morgan sitting out the Bangladesh series over security concerns, wicketkeeper-batsman Jos Buttler was tasked with leading a young and inexperienced squad against a side that had won their six previous home ODI series. "Me and Jos work quite well. We're quite aggressive in how we want to play our cricket, not just with the bat and the ball, but with field placings," Stokes, who was vice-captain for the series, said. Morgan and influential opening batsman Alex Hales are expected to return to the squad when England travel to India for their next three-match ODI series in January.</snippet>

So we tried to help him find a new one.” Watanabe, from Miki, a small town in the Kagawa prefecture in Japan, is proving to be a quick learner as he navigates through his freshman year at George Washington and his second year in the United States. During a game against Saint Louis earlier this month, Watanabe made a key 3-pointer midway through the second half to give the Colonials a 52-49 lead, capping a 13-0 run. While running back on defense, Watanabe lifted three fingers on his right hand and repeatedly pointed to his head, mimicking Carmelo Anthony’s “three to the dome” celebration.</snippet>

	<snippet xmlns="http://www.semanticweb.org/newsanalytics/ontologies/2016//">The sport has gained popularity in Japan after the team eighth-place showing at the 2016 Olympics, especially with the 2020 Games set for Tokyo. For two quarters during a game at the Rio Olympics in August, Japan made the vaunted United States women’s national basketball team appear mortal. Late in the first half of their quarterfinal game, Japan even cut the Americans’ lead to 2 points, at 48-46, on a layup by Ramu Tokashiki. Order was later restored, as the Americans adjusted to Japan’s up-tempo offense and coasted to a 46-point victory. For the United States, the first-half challenge was a galvanizing moment, one that helped spur them toward their sixth straight gold medal. For Japan, the loss — even one in which it surrendered 110 points — proved even more inspiring. It served as another important moment, perhaps the biggest one to date, in the rise of women’s basketball as Japan prepares to host the next Summer Olympics in 2020. “Obviously we wanted to win a medal, that was the main goal,” said the national team assistant coach Tom Hovasse, an American who played four minutes with the Atlanta Hawks during the 1994-95 season. “I had another goal going into Rio: that was to put Japan basketball on the main stage, show the world what we can do, and to gain respect from other countries and other countries’ coaches. We did that more than I could have imagined.”</snippet>

	<snippet xmlns="http://www.semanticweb.org/newsanalytics/ontologies/2016//">Getting eliminated early as host of a global championship is bad enough, but one thing that can make it worse is when it happens at the hand of your bitterest rival. That’s the prospect facing India as it plays Pakistan in the World Twenty20 in Kolkata, India, on Saturday.India already lost its first match of the tournament against New Zealand Tuesday, when it was bowled out for only 79 runs. Pakistan, meanwhile, opened with a victory over Afghanistan. India will not be eliminated if it loses Saturday, but would need to win its two remaining pool matches against Australia and Afghanistan, and for other results to break in its favor, to have any chance of progressing as one of the top two from the five-team pool. This is not what either India’s vast cricketing public, or the oddsmakers who made it a clear favorite, expected. But World T20s are hard to predict. “If you look at the World T20 events that happened before, none of the teams that won were thought of as favorites before the event began,” said Pakistan’s coach, Waqar Younis, before the tournament. “If you play well in those three weeks, you can win the cup.”</snippet>

	<headline xmlns="http://www.semanticweb.org/newsanalytics/ontologies/2016//">Stokes Believes In-Form England Can Top ODI Rankings</headline>
	<snippet xmlns="http://www.semanticweb.org/newsanalytics/ontologies/2016//">England will climb to the top of the one-day international (ODI) cricket world rankings if they can maintain their fine form in the format, all-rounder Ben Stokes said after the side completed a series victory in Bangladesh. Stokes played a key role with an unbeaten 47 as England won the deciding third match against the hosts in Chittagong on Wednesday to wrap up a third successive one-day series triumph, having beaten Sri Lanka and Pakistan at home earlier this year. England are currently fifth in the ODI rankings, behind Australia, South Africa, New Zealand and India. "It's really exciting. If we carry on like this we'll achieve our target of being world number one," Stokes, who was named the man of the series, told Sky Sports. England's loss to Bangladesh in Adelaide, which knocked them out of the 2015 ODI World Cup, spurred a string of changes to the national team set-up and Stokes felt the squad are starting to yield the dividends of the strategy. "The team we have had together for the last 18 months have been playing unbelievable cricket," the 25-year-old added. With skipper Eoin Morgan sitting out the Bangladesh series over security concerns, wicketkeeper-batsman Jos Buttler was tasked with leading a young and inexperienced squad against a side that had won their six previous home ODI series. "Me and Jos work quite well. We're quite aggressive in how we want to play our cricket, not just with the bat and the ball, but with field placings," Stokes, who was vice-captain for the series, said. Morgan and influential opening batsman Alex Hales are expected to return to the squad when England travel to India for their next three-match ODI series in January.</snippet>

	<headline xmlns="http://www.semanticweb.org/newsanalytics/ontologies/2016//">Broad Targets England ODI Return for 2019 World Cup</headline>
	<snippet xmlns="http://www.semanticweb.org/newsanalytics/ontologies/2016//">Fast bowler Stuart Broad has fallen out of contention for a regular starting place in England's one-day international side but the test stalwart is "desperate" to represent his country at the 2019 World Cup on home soil. Broad, who climbed to the top of the test bowlers rankings earlier this year, was part of the England side that made an embarrassing group stage exit at the 2015 World Cup and has barely featured since. England have prospered in white-ball cricket after making sweeping changes to their tactics and personnel in the wake of the disastrous showing in Australia and New Zealand, and Broad has only featured in two matches during that rebuilding period. England and Wales are hosting the 2017 Champions Trophy and the World Cup two year later, and the 30-year-old Broad is determined to do everything necessary to fight his way back into the side. "I'm desperate, as I think every England cricketer would be, to play at the 2019 World Cup in England," Broad, who has taken 178 wickets in 121 ODIs, told Sky Sports. "It is a long way away but it will creep up. "The tricky part of playing a lot of test cricket, I've played 48 on the bounce now, is you don't actually get a lot of time to play white-ball cricket so it's quite hard to keep up with the standard in a game that moves forward so quickly." Since last appearing in those two ODIs in South Africa in February, Broad failed to feature in England's home one-day series wins over Sri Lanka and Pakistan and was also overlooked for the three matches in Bangladesh, beginning on Friday. "I'm trying to find more time to play white-ball cricket," Broad added. "I've got a bit of a proven track record with the white ball, my stats are pretty good in the 50-over stuff, I just need to play a bit more of it."</snippet>

	<snippet xmlns="http://www.semanticweb.org/newsanalytics/ontologies/2016//">The automotive history of the former Soviet Bloc resonates with cars like the funky Lada, the futuristic Tatra, the clunky but lovable Trabant and the luxurious Volga. Then there was the tanklike Zil — always in black — that shuttled Nikita S. Khrushchev and Alexei N. Kosygin through Red Square. Most of those car brands are relegated to history. These days, Russians with money to spend are drawn to high-end vehicles from the West: technology-rich sedans, luxury limousines, high-riding sport utility vehicles and names like Cayenne, S-Class and 7 Series. Over all, car sales in Russia have been in a free fall, driven by Western economic sanctions and the collapse of oil prices, to fewer than 1.5 million last year from nearly three million in 2014. But luxury carmakers such as Porsche, BMW and Mercedes-Benz say they believe that the economic crisis has enticed the rich to take advantage of the weak ruble and invest in high-end cars, which traditionally do not depreciate as much in Russia as they do in the West.</snippet>

	<snippet xmlns="http://www.semanticweb.org/newsanalytics/ontologies/2016//">Lionel Messi’s penalty kick in stoppage time of a pulsating 3-2 win at Valencia on Saturday moved Barcelona atop the Spanish league, but the victory came at a cost: Andrés Iniesta sustained ligament damage in his right knee that could keep him out for several months. Messi also scored in the 22nd minute, a goal that was allowed to stand even though Luis Suárez had strayed offside. Valencia responded after halftime with goals by Munir El Haddadi and Rodrigo in a six-minute stretch. Suárez tied the game in the 62nd minute, and deep in stoppage time, he was upended inside the penalty box by Aymen Abdennour. Valencia goalkeeper Diego Alves had already saved three penalty kicks this season, but Messi sent the ball into the bottom corner to secure a vital 3 points for Barcelona in the title race. It was his sixth goal in three games since he returned from a groin injury. “Messi took responsibility in the best moment, and it is a glorious feeling for us,” Coach Luis Enrique said. The game was only 14 minutes old when Iniesta, Barcelona’s captain, was carried from the field in tears while holding his right knee, which had buckled under a heavy challenge from Enzo Pérez. Enrique was furious with the referee because Pérez was not given even a yellow card.</snippet>

	<snippet xmlns="http://www.semanticweb.org/newsanalytics/ontologies/2016//">Ray Allen won N.B.A. championships in Boston and Miami, made one of the most memorable shots in N.B.A. finals history and has more 3-pointers than anyone else who played in the league.
More than two years after his last game, he has decided that was enough. Allen announced his retirement Tuesday in a post on The Players’ Tribune website. Allen spent 18 seasons in the league with Milwaukee, Seattle, the Celtics and the Heat, averaging 18.9 points in 1,300 career regular-season games and appearing in 10 All-Star Games. “I write this to you today as a 41-year-old man who is retiring from the game,” Allen said in his post, which was in the form of a letter to his younger self. “I write to you as a man who is completely at peace with himself.” Allen entertained thoughts about a comeback over the last two years and had plenty of opportunities from title-contending teams. But nothing ever lured him back, although the door always remained a tiny bit open — until now. “Basketball will take you far away from that school yard,” Allen wrote. “You will become far more than just a basketball player. You’ll get to act in movies. You’ll travel the world. You will become a husband, and the father of five amazing children.”</snippet>

Twenty years after joining the league, the WNBAs chief of basketball operations and player relations is stepping down this month. Brown is one of a handful of people still involved in the league since its beginning. In her current role and through her work with the WNBA's competition committee, Brown has directly influenced how the game is played. This past season, teams set records for points per game, field goals made and attempted, field goal percentage, free throws made, free throw percentage and assists. Brown has also been involved with USA Basketball since 1996. She has served on its board of directors and chaired the selection committee of the senior national team.

	<headline xmlns="http://www.semanticweb.org/newsanalytics/ontologies/2016//">Russell Westbrook’s Hot Start Cooled by Kevin Durant’s Warriors</headline>
	<snippet xmlns="http://www.semanticweb.org/newsanalytics/ontologies/2016//">For eight seasons, Russell Westbrook played magnificently for the Oklahoma City Thunder. He made five All-Star Games and led the N.B.A. in scoring. The team went on six playoff runs, including a trip to the N.B.A. finals. And throughout those years, he was accompanied by his fellow superstar Kevin Durant. With the shocking news in July that Durant had signed as a free agent with the mighty Warriors, Westbrook was left without a co-star for the first time. He has responded by trying to do it all, and has mostly succeeded. In his first four games this season, Westbrook scored 32, 51, 33 and 35 points. The 51-point effort against the Suns was only the second 50-point game of his career. A 6-foot-3 point guard, he pulled down 10 or more rebounds in three of those games. And Oklahoma City won them all, as well. But the real test came Thursday night, when Westbrook and the Thunder faced Durant and the Warriors in Oakland. Early on, with the Thunder leading by 12-7, Warriors Coach Steve Kerr charged onto the court to protest a no-call when Stephen Curry was knocked to the ground. He was hit with a technical and flirted with ejection. At one point in the first quarter, the Thunder were up, 31-21. It seemed like the Westbrook show was ready for another big night. The Warriors then went on a 47-12 run to put the game out of reach by halftime. Westbrook shot 4 for 15. In contrast, Durant was dominant, putting in a season-high 39 points on 15-for-24 shooting. He matched a career high with seven 3-pointers. The Warriors beat the Thunder, 122-96.</snippet>

	<snippet xmlns="http://www.semanticweb.org/newsanalytics/ontologies/2016//">Aaron Davidson, a sports marketing executive, was convicted in a federal court in Brooklyn on charges of racketeering conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy. His conviction was the 20th to be announced by the Department of Justice in its far-reaching prosecutions of sports officials and business executives connected to FIFA, soccer’s global governing body, and affiliated regional organizations. Mr. Davidson, 45, a sports marketing executive, admitted to negotiating and paying more than $14 million in bribes to soccer officials on behalf of Traffic Sports USA, a firm headquartered on Brickell Key, a private island in Miami where Mr. Davidson lives. Those bribes helped Traffic secure lucrative media and marketing contracts, including the rights to major international tournaments. Mr. Davidson, who began working for Traffic as a salesman in 2003, said on Thursday that he had learned about the company’s practice of paying bribes for business in 2009 and that he had begun participating in such schemes in 2012. “I knew making the bribe payment was illegal and was concerned about making it,” he said of one transaction, noting that he had falsified an invoice to make it seem legitimate. Mr. Davidson faces up to 40 years in prison for the two charges to which he admitted. He agreed to forfeit more than half a million dollars to the United States, adding to the more than $200 million promised to the government by people convicted in the case. In his plea on Thursday, Mr. Davidson invoked others who had been convicted and had promised the bulk of that money. He mentioned José Hawilla of Brazil, owner of Traffic USA and its parent company, Traffic International — two corporate defendants in the case — and Jeffrey Webb, a former FIFA executive and regional soccer association president to whom Traffic paid bribes.</snippet>
